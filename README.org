* Subjective C

Subjective C is an implementation of Objective C that I wrote many years ago
--- some time around 1993. It uses a hand-written parser to find Objective C
code and turn it into ANSII C.

As part of the compliation process, the Perl script src/runtime/makejump.pl
munges the C compiler's assemply code output to turn a jsr into a jump into
the code that implements method lookup. The script only works for Motorola
68k and Intel i86 processors.

Included are a few basic library classes: List, Dictionary, String, Stream,
and Zone.
