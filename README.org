* Subjective C

Subjective C is an incomplete implementation of Objective C that I wrote
many years ago --- some time around 1993. It uses a hand-written parser to
find Objective C code and turn it into ANSII C. As part of the compliation
process, a small Perl script munges the C compiler's assemply code output to
turn a jsr into a jump into the code that implements method lookup.

Included are a few basic library classes: List, Dictionary, String, Stream,
and Zone.
